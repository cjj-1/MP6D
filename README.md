# MP6D: An RGB-D Dataset for Metal Partsâ€™ 6D Pose Estimation
Information
===========

This is the MP6D dataset [1] for 6D object pose estimation.
It contains 20 videos (6,000 frames in total) of 5 metal parts in real scenes and 20,000 synthetic images, each of which is partially affected by occlusion, illumination changes,
and other factors.
