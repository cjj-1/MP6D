# MP6D: An RGB-D Dataset for Metal Partsâ€™ 6D Pose Estimation
Information
===========

This is the MP6D dataset [1] for 6D object pose estimation.
It contains 20 videos (6,000 frames in total) of 5 metal parts in real scenes and 20,000 synthetic images, each of which is partially affected by occlusion, illumination changes,
and other factors.
## Instance models and CAD models of 5 objects.

(a) Five metal parts with oxidized aluminum alloy surface. (b) CAD models of the metal parts.

## Real and rendered scenes

(a), (b), (c) and (d) represent the examples of
the real scenes. (e), (f), (g) and (h) represent the examples of the synthesis scenes.

Basic Usage
===========

## The description of the directories in this package:

1. cameras. The camera parameters used to capture the videos. 
2. data. The 20 videos in the dataset.
3. data_syn. 20,000 synthetic images of the 5 objects.
4. image_sets. Separation of the videos into training set (train.txt) and the testing set (test.txt).
6. plymodels. 5 CAD models of Ply format.

## The description of the Archive  in the directories:
The data of each frame is composed of RGB image, Depth image, Mask image and xxx.mat. The content data of xxx.mat is as follows.
<div align=center><img width="50%" src="src/fig3.png"/></div>
1.center: 2D location of the projection of the 3D model origin in the image
2.cls_indexes: class labels of the objects
3.factor_depth: divde the depth image by this factor to get the actual depth vaule
4.intrinsic_matrix: camera intrinsics
5.poses: 6D poses of objects in the image
